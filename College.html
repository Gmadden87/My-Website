            <p> I've been playing sports since I can remember, however it wasn't until 7th grade That I first tried the hurdles. I fell in love with it and still continue it today. Track has opened up opportunities to me that I couldn't get any other way. I was fortunate enough to be able to travel the country form Cali to New York City to compete against other top hurdlers in the nation. I compete in the 60m and 110m hurdles for Umaine, it is a great experience and I love every moment of training and competing. It is a great way to see amazing new places and meet incredible people!

            <p>The outdoors always interested me and I loved being outside and active, I like to hike, run, swim, play sports really anything that is active or competitive. Basketball and Football are my favorites, I try to play as much as I can! I also love space and the cosmos, it is one of if not the most interesting concept there is. I will go out with friends to open fields and camp out and watch the stars.
            <p>Some other hobbies of mine that my fraternity brothers play a lot are risk, Super Smash Brothers & Super Mario Kart (these cause friendships to fall), cards and especially Fornite we always play Fortnite. I currently live in my fraternity house in a section called the RAM, I live up there with 3 other brothers and it is a really cool experience! It's not often you can say you lived in a mansion with 30 of your good friends!</p>

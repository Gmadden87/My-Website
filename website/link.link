                <p>I was born on July 13th, 1998 in Charlotte, North Carolina.
                I moved to Scarborough, Maine when I was in 2nd grade.</p>
                <p>I started playing sports since I could remember, however I didn't start my two favorite sports
                football and track until I was in middle school. I loved them while I was in high school
                and was fortunate enough to be be able to continue my athletic career in college.</p>
                <p>I chose the University of Maine after I had a recruiting visit
                in the spring of my senior year in high school, and I haven't regretted it since.</p>
